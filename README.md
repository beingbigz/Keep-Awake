## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

### Windows
- Windows 7 or later
- No additional software required

### macOS
- macOS 10.12 (Sierra) or later
- Uses built-in `caffeinate` command

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Use Pre-built Executable (Windows)
1. Download `KeepAwake.exe` from the releases
2. Run the executable directly - no installation needed
3. The application will appear in your system tray

### Option 2: Run from Source
```bash
# Clone or download the repository
# Install required dependencies
pip install pystray pillow

# Run the application
python "keep awake.py"
```

## üöÄ Usage

### GUI Mode (Default)
1. Launch the application
2. Look for the Keep Awake icon in your system tray
3. Right-click the tray icon to access options:
   - **System**: Toggle between keeping system awake and normal power management
   - **Display**: Toggle whether to keep display on or allow it to turn off
   - **Startup**: Enable/disable automatic startup with Windows (Windows only)
   - **Timer**: Set automatic quit timer with options from 10 seconds to 4 years
     - Unlimited time (Default)
     - Quick options: 10 seconds, 5/15/30 minutes, 1-16 hours
     - Extended options: 1-16 days, 1-8 months, 1-4 years
   - **Information**: Help and usage information
   - **Quit this software**: Exit the application and restore normal power settings

### Console Mode
If GUI components are not available, the application automatically runs in console mode with full command interface:
```bash
python "keep awake.py"
```
**Available commands:**
- `s` - Toggle system awake/sleep
- `d` - Toggle display on/off
- `r` - Toggle startup with Windows (Windows only)
- `t` - Set auto-quit timer
- `q` - Quit application
- `Ctrl+C` - Emergency stop and restore normal power management

### Timer Options
The timer feature allows you to automatically quit the software after a specified time:
- **Unlimited time (Default)**: Never automatically quit
- **Quick timers**: 10 seconds, 5/15/30 minutes, 1-16 hours
- **Extended timers**: 1-16 days, 1-8 months, 1-4 years
- **Real-time countdown**: Tray icon shows remaining time
- **Automatic cleanup**: Restores normal power management before quitting

### Duration Mode (Programmatic)
You can also use the application to keep the system awake for a specific duration:
```python
from keep_awake import keep_awake_for_duration

# Keep awake for 2 hours
keep_awake_for_duration(120)
```

## üîß How It Works

### Windows
- Uses the Windows API `SetThreadExecutionState` function
- Sets `ES_CONTINUOUS | ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED` flags by default
- Optionally adds `ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED` flag when display keep-on is enabled
- Prevents system sleep while allowing display sleep control
- Integrates with Windows startup registry for auto-start functionality

### macOS
- Utilizes the built-in `caffeinate` command
- Runs `caffeinate -s` to prevent system sleep
- Optionally runs `caffeinate -s -d` to also prevent display sleep
- Allows flexible display sleep control based on user preference

## üìã Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Python 3.6+** (for source version)
- **pystray**: System tray integration
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Icon generation
- **tkinter**: GUI components (usually included with Python)

## üîÑ States

### System States
- **Awake**: System stays awake, display control based on setting
- **Sleep**: Normal power management restored

### Display States
- **Display ON**: Screen stays on (prevents display sleep)
- **Display OFF**: Screen can turn off based on power settings

### Startup States (Windows only)
- **Startup ON**: Application starts automatically with Windows
- **Startup OFF**: Manual application start required

### Timer States
- **Unlimited time**: Default state, runs until manually quit
- **Active Timer**: Countdown active, shows remaining time in tray
- **Expired**: Timer reached zero, software automatically quits

### Tray Icon Status
Shows comprehensive status: "Keep Awake | [System] | Display [State] | Startup [State] | Timer [Status]"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application doesn't appear in system tray:**
- Check if the application is running in console mode
- Ensure pystray and PIL are properly installed
- Try running from command line to see error messages

**System still goes to sleep:**
- Verify the application is in "AWAKE" state (check tray icon)
- Check Windows power settings for USB selective suspend
- On macOS, ensure the application has proper permissions
- Verify timer hasn't expired (check timer status in tray)

**Timer doesn't work:**
- Check timer status in tray icon title
- Verify timer is set to a duration other than "Unlimited time"
- Console mode shows timer countdown - use 't' command to check
- Timer automatically restores power management before quitting

**Startup integration fails (Windows):**
- Run application as administrator once to set registry entry
- Check Windows startup settings in Task Manager
- Verify antivirus isn't blocking registry modifications

**Build executable fails:**
- Ensure PyInstaller is installed: `pip install pyinstaller`
- Check that all dependencies are available
- Try building without `--windowed` flag for debugging

### Error Messages

**"pystray and/or PIL not available"**
```bash
pip install pystray pillow
```

**"Startup option is only available on Windows"**
- This is expected behavior on macOS and Linux systems
- Startup integration only works on Windows platform

**"Timer expired - quitting this software"**
- This is normal behavior when a timer reaches zero
- Set timer to "Unlimited time" to disable auto-quit
- Timer automatically restores normal power management

## üèóÔ∏è Building from Source
